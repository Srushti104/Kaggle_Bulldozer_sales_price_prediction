Further fine tuning or optimization can be done by selecting a differnt combinations of features and perhaps replacing YearMade with the corrected data. We can get the more relevant data from Machine_Appendix.csv. At the end, as per the competition rule, we have predicted the salesPrice for the salesID on test set and store in .csv file. "
